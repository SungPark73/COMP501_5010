<p>Firstly, The voting programme of the machines could be exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks such as malwares or DDOS attack. Malware attack is done by any type of malicious software that is designed to cause harm or damage to a computer, server and network. The problem of malware attack is that once the malicious software is installed on one machine, it could spread virally from machine to machine. Moreover, when the machines transit the results to the central system to count the ballots it may infect the central system. DDOS attack makes online services, network service or machines unavailable with millions of requests that are overwhelming for the machine. It will delay the voting process and this may lead to bigger problems. It cannot be guaranteed that the security of the voting programme is 100% safe and unhackable. Hackers may be able to find the vulnerability of the system and it’s a huge problem since the result of the vote could be modified. The machines at the polling place could be under attack or manipulated by someone while they are unattended. For instance, a different programme can be installed on the machines and nobody may notice the difference. These risks may result in inoperativeness of the machines and the replacement of them could delay the voting speed. </p>
<p>The transit of votes is one of the concerns since there are various ways for it. All the machines could be transported to the counting place but it is physically impossible. The votes of each machine can be downloaded to an USB stick and transported, but this way the data can be lost on the way of transit. The votes could be directly sent to the counting server through internet, however, this way the result may not be trusted as there is no proof that the correct votes have been sent. Also, it is more difficult to detect and identify the source of errors with EVMs. It will get more difficult for non-expert to figure out the problem and voters may need to wait until the experts arrive and fix the problem. </p>
<p>The electronic voting system also costs much. The cost includes software updates, replacement of outdated voting machines, maintenance etc. Turquoise and Lawrence(2022) assumed that the cost of replacing equipment first fielded between 2010 and 2016 will be more than $230 million, for a total cost of more than $580 million for replacing outdated voting equipment over the next five years in the USA and The Center for Secure and Modern Elections of America(2022) has estimated that “the full cost of replacing outdated voting machines over the next decade will amount to $1.8 billion” in America.</p>
<p>The young generation may find it easy to vote with electronic voting machines, however, old generations may struggle with the new system. In addition, people in rural areas may need to travel a long distance to vote since the machines require electricity. The public trust is also an issue since people do not have access to the ballot counting process and there is no visible or clear evidence to check if the votes have been correctly recorded or the total number of ballots. Even though it is the machine company’s responsibility to protect the machines and the software against frauds and other risks, the voter's right to know cannot be ignored. There is another problem which is trust in the machine companies. It may be easy for the machine companies to control the machines and modify the result of the votes. Furthermore, the vendors selling EVMs are in competition and it cannot be guaranteed that they aim to produce the machines with the interest of the voters and ballot counting accuracy rather than cheaper machines for their benefits. The anonymity of voters cannot be guaranteed with an electronic voting system. Voters have to enter their personal details to the system to verify themselves and this can cause serious problems such as privacy issues and it would be possible to find out who the voters voted for and it is obviously against the anonymity of the vote, however without personal details of voters it would be difficult to verify if the voters have right to vote. For example, people who do not have the right to vote such as foreigners and minors would be able to vote. </p>
