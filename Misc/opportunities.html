<h1 id="myHeader">Technology Opportunities</h1>

<p>There are many opportunities gained from using electronic voting machines and all are very beneficial to a thriving democracy. 
They are a promising representation that although the road to ensuring EVM security is ironclad, it is obviously worth it.</p>
<br> 
</ul><h2>Efficiency:</h2>
<p>Electronic voting machines are renowned for providing a clearer presentation of who you’re voting for. 
This helps reduce the probability of someone voting for the wrong or picking too many candidates, thus improving the general integrity of voting. 
An example of this going horribly wrong was during the 2000 US presidential election recount.
In Florida, during this election they chose a punch-card voting machine method. 
This had many problems with design and “chads” (hanging paper) that caused confusion as it failed to distinguish votes. 
This could very easily swing an election in a dishonest way.
The rise of scan technology in newly adopted machines has organizers hoping the voter's choice is secure.</p>

<h2>Fraud detection/prevention:</h2>
<p>In the past ballots have been known to be tampered with. Although there is a chance electronic voting machines could be compromised some would argue ballots are less secure. 
This has been a heated topic particularly in the U.S with the 2020 election where paper ballots and their legitimacy were discussed. 
Michael Shamos of Carnegie Mellon University who favors electronic voting argues that 
“Paper voting records have shown themselves for the past 250 years to be horribly insecure and easy to manipulate. In practice they have so many flaws that they are as bad as punched card voting at its worst.” 
Electronic Voting Machines as the main method of voting is fast becoming inevitable. In-fact judging by the figure to the right it basically is, in the U.S at least. This adoption should be a indication that 
fighting against machines at this point is futile and that the focus should be on ensuring their security. </p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Electronic voting/machines also give the opportunity to people with disabilities/impairments the chance to vote. 
For example, people with visual impairments could have the ability to vote with audio ballets. This is a huge advantage as it ensures everyone feels a apart of the democratic process.
The advent of online voting is an interesting thing that could be linked to the voting infrastructure, thus increasing the accessibility even further. 
Online voting linked to electronic voting machines could allows physically disabled people to have their voices heard. Citizens who are housebound for any reason could now have the opportunity to vote.
This could be helpful for physically disabled people or even sick people stuck at home or perhaps in hospital. 
This is also extremely useful for rural voters who's voting locations might be located far from where they reside. Online voting could give them the chance they didn't have previously to participate in electoral processes.</p>

<p>The YouTube video above is a great example of the current and potential accessibility benefits voting machines have. 
<h2>Cost and the Environment</h2>
<p>Although the cost isn't as important as the previous points in terms of its impact on society I still think its an important thing to mention. 
The savings incured from using voting machines to keep vote counts over workers could become huge. This saved money could be redirected into securing the machines thus increasing the overall security of the election.
However, this benefit could be seen as a good and a bad. 
It might be good if the money went back into security but it could also be bad as their would be layoffs due to not needing as much labour for counting votes etc. 
Automation is already fast becoming a problem as machines become more efficient so this could be seen as a negative thing and is definetely something to be discussed. 
<br>
<br>
Electronic forms of voting could also be advantageous environmentally as the reduction of paper (for paper ballots) would be massive. This reduction would see less trees being felled in order to create these ballots.
Online voting as mentioned earlier could also be beneficial to the environment. This is because it could in theory lead to less people travelling and therefore less carbon dioxide emission. </p>
