</ul><h2>Efficiency:</h2>
<p>Electronic voting machines are renowned for providing a clearer presentation of who you’re voting for. 
This helps reduce the probability of someone voting for the wrong or picking too many candidates, thus improving the general integrity of voting. 
An example of this going horribly wrong was during the 2000 US presidential election recount.
In Florida, during this election they chose a punch-card voting machine method. 
This had many problems with design and “chads” (hanging paper) that caused confusion as it failed to distinguish votes. 
The rise of scan technology in newly adopted machines has organizers hoping the voter's choice is secure.</p>

<h2>Fraud detection:</h2>
<p>In the past ballots have been known to be tampered with. Although there is a chance electronic voting machines could be compromised some would argue ballots are less secure. 
Michael Shamos of Carnegie Mellon University who favors electronic voting argues that 
“Paper voting records have shown themselves for the past 250 years to be horribly insecure and easy to manipulate. In practice they have so many flaws that they are as bad as punched card voting at its worst.”
