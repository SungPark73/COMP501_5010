<p>Electronic voting machines are renowned for providing a clearer presentation of who you’re voting for. 
This helps reduce the probability of someone voting for the wrong or picking too many candidates, thus improving the general integrity of voting.

<p>An example of this going horribly wrong was during the 2000 US presidential election recount.
In Florida, during this election they chose a punch-card voting machine method. 
This had many problems with design and “chads” (hanging paper) that caused confusion as it failed to distinguish votes. 
The rise of scan technology in newly adopted machines has organizers hoping the voter's choice is secure.</p>
