<p>Electronic Voting Machines are a reasonably new method of voting that involves does away with paper ballots. 
Usually these machines are computers which show the ballots on the screen and receive input through touchscreen/button or some other method.
They have been used since the early 70's but have only really become ubiquitous on the turn of the millennium.
Online voting is another part of electronic voting and although its not entirely the focus of this Web resource we think its got huge potential and is worth touching on.
Voting through the internet (online voting) is something we think is the best thing that could happen for democratic processes. 
We think this because the ability to just hop online and be able to vote from your house cuts down so many constraints one might have from going in and physically voting.
Online voting definitely seems like something that will become more and more prevalent as its accessibility advantages are too powerful to ignore.
However, just like electronic voting machines online voting is hugely at risk security wise. 
In fact some would argue its at even more of a risk as it is no longer a physical technological presence its now in the cloud and vulnerable to more attacks. 
 Although we touch on the idea and conversion surrounding online voting we see that as a separate issue.

<p>As with any technological innovations social concern from apprehensive citizens has arose.
This was particularly concerning for many people as any new method could harbour negative results. 
In particular the security. Although there haven't been concrete examples of electronic voting machines being hacked the vulnerability is still there. 
With the rise of hackers interfering with many technology enterprises the risk is certainly a legitimate one. This is why we decided to pick EVM's.
This was evident in the 2016 U.S election where an investigation by the F.B.I started to look into the supposed Russian interference. 
Although claims weren't that voting machines were being hacked, there is clearly some interference in elections showing us that nothings off the table.
Peoples expectations that their vote is valid is not too much to ask. So its important that the organizers of elections take note of the risks involved with EVMs. 
</p>
<p>This topic is hugely significant as its so important for people to trust the electoral processes in democratic nations.
Voting is the only way an everyday citizen can influence the world around them without being a politician themselves. 
And if this process is at risk due to security susceptibility then it has major negative implications for the respective nation. 
The thought that one genius but terrible hacker could breach the security of a electronic voting machine may seem silly. 
However, this worry shouldn't be discarded and should taken into account. An example of the destruction just one man can cause is Kevin Mitnick.
Kevin Mitnick grew up hacking. From a young age he was fascinated with what we could do with technology. Unfortunately like a lot of people he wasn't always thinking for the better.
After gaining unauthorized access to strangers devices and software he was able to leverage many peoples private information for malicious purposes.
Eventually Mitnick's crimes caught up with him and he plead guilty to four counts of wire fraud, two counts of computer fraud and more. 
This situation is a big reason why security with any technology of importance is crucial. And in the case of EVMs is vital for ensuring a fair and secure election.
</p>
<p>Its not all doom and gloom though. We think EVM's have a lot of potential as we elaborate on in the opportunities page. 
We also touch on some more risks and the solutions that could be undertaken to enhance the security of electronic voting machines. 
This topic should really be explored further. Although there were plenty of good resources we don't think there was enough. 
We think studies into machines themselves should be taken with attempts at testing their security. 
Perhaps 'white hats' as mentioned in the choices page could be involved in these security test/studies.
