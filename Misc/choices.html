<h4><p>In the previous page, the risks of electronic voting machines have been
  described. This page will demonstrate the possible solutions to prevent
  some of the problems.<p></h4>
  <p>first risk given is that the software of the voting machines could be under cyber-attacks. The problem could be prevented in several ways. The first method is securing databases and networks. The risk of cyber-attack can be minimized by setting firewalls and encryption of data. Firewall will track the traffic between the machine and the internet. Data encryption is converting the data into encrypted code and this will make the data unreadable even if data theft happens. This will help secure personal information of voters and enhance the security of communi	cation between the voting machines and servers. Keeping the voting software on all the machines up to date is also important. The older version of software is more vulnerable and prone to cyber-attacks because more security flaws are found as the time goes on and this makes it easier for hackers to find the ways to harm the software. Latest version of software has not only stronger security but also better performance.</p>
  <p>Installation of security softwares will help prevent cyber-attacks. The software should include anti-virus and anti-spyware. These two softwares will scan the hard disk of EVMs to check if there are viruses, Trojan horses and worms and remove them if found. The machine companies can ask independent computer science experts to test the programme and give feedback or hire ‘white hats’ to find out the vulnerabilities of the programme and fix them before the attacks actually happen. White hats refer to ethical hackers who are motivated to identify vulnerabilities of security and inform them to the manufacturer or the client organization.</p>

  <p>Blockchain each vote would be a good way to track all the transactions. Blockchain is one of data structures and it is impossible to enforce insertion, deletion or alteration to the existing block without trace since data is stored in the blocks created during the validate transactions. In order to prevent the physical attacks to the hardware, cameras or alarms can be installed at the polling spaces or guards can be hired during the vote seasons to keep the machines.</p>

  <p>The concerns regarding inoperative machines could be simply sorted by having another machine for back up. It is recommended to have at least two machines at the same place so the vote can still proceed in case one of the machines does not work. There would be not only old generations but also young people struggling with how the electronic voting machines work. Therefore, There should be trained staff at the polling places to show people how to use the voting machines. People who live in rural areas may need to travel a long distance, however, portable electricity generators can come with the voting machines to save time.</p>
  <p>The voting system can be modified to require only minimum personal details of voters to minimize the risk of privacy problems. Also, personal details can be converted into a secret code using encryption and it will help prevent crimes such as data theft. Implementing multi factor authentication will add another layer of security to keep the personal information safe. Perhaps, people can receive verification code to enter the system through texts or emails and this way there will be less concerns regarding privacy issues. There is a way for voters to keep track of their votes which is assigning secret codes to each voter. The codes could be a combination of upper and lower cases, numbers and special characters for strong security. Voters can enter their own secret codes to check if they have voted correctly and their votes have been counted. Restrictions of the access to the system would help minimizing the risk since only a limited number of technicians will be allowed to access the system. Technicians should have access to only the part of the system that they need to work on and their work should be trackable to ensure that they only completed assigned tasks. Network monitoring and logging checks need to be implemented to catch any suspicious and abnormal activities such as contacting unusual IP addresses or websites. Pre-election testing on all the voting machines can be conducted prior to the actual election to ensure that all the machines are in good working conditions. Also, it has to be checked if the correct voting programme is installed on the machines and the programme performs properly.</p>
