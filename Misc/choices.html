</ul><h4><p>In the previous page, the risks of electronic voting machines have been
  described. This page will demonstrate the possible solutions to prevent
  some of the problems.<p></h4>
<p>The first risk given is that the software of the voting machines could
  be under cyber-attacks. The problem could be prevented in several
  ways. The first method is securing databases and networks. The risk of
  cyber-attack can be minimized by setting firewalls and encryption of
  data. Firewall will track the traffic between the machine and the internet.
  Keeping the voting software on all the machines up to date is also
  important. The older version of software is more vulnerable and prone
  to cyber-attacks. Installation of security software will help prevent
  cyber-attacks. The software should include anti-virus and anti-spyware.
  The machine companies can ask independent computer science experts
  to test the programme and give feedback or hire ‘white hats’ to find
  out the vulnerabilities of the programme and fix them before the
  attacks actually happen. White hats refer to ethical hackers who are
  motivated to identify vulnerabilities of security and inform them to the
  manufacturer or the client organization. In order to prevent the physical
  attacks to the hardware, cameras or alarms can be installed at the
  polling spaces or guards can be hired during the vote seasons to keep
  the machines.</p>
<p>The concerns regarding inoperative machines could be simply sorted
    by having another machine for back up. It is recommended to have at
    least two machines at the same place so the vote can still proceed in
    case one of the machines does not work. There would be not only old
    generations but also young people struggling with how the electronic
    voting machines work. Therefore, There should be trained staff at the
    polling places to show people how to use the voting machines. People
    who live in rural areas may need to travel a long distance, however,
    portable electricity generators can come with the voting machines to
    save time.</p>
<p>The voting system can be modified to require only minimum personal
      details of voters to minimize the risk of privacy problems. Also, personal
      details can be converted into a secret code using encryption and it will
      help prevent crimes such as data theft. Implementing multi factor
      authentication will add another layer of security to keep the personal
      information safe. Perhaps, people can receive verification code to enter
      the system through texts or emails and this way there will be less
      concerns regarding privacy issues. Pre-election testing on all the voting
      machines can be conducted prior to the actual election to ensure that
      all the machines are in good working conditions. Also, it has to be
      checked if the correct voting programme is installed on the machines
      and the programme performs properly.</p>
